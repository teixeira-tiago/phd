This project was build to test some equations that could help to solve the problems that represents the core of my Phd studies.

During the build of this project I used some tools of the Python Language, in a way that they was put just few code line each other, with this I guess this project could help to understand a practical way to use these tools.

Because my main language be Portuguese, and I didn’t start this project thinking in put it to international public, some variables name may is in a kind of Portuguese acronym, when it isn't in Portuguese, Sorry for that and I could have some help to translate all to English.

The core of this project is test which equation could be the best to filter something like 60 TB/s to find the correct 1.5GB/s a reduction of 1:400,000, or find one correct bit in the middle of 399,999 wrong bits. It happen in the calorimetry studies, but might be used in all fields where have wave collisions like Wi-Fi, Satellite, Microwaves interference, Sound, ...

To do tests you should start trying understand the content of the file sampleTestSystem.py in the folder tests, I created this file only for tests purposes.
